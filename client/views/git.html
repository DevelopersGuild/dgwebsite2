                At Developers’ Guild, we prefer using Git to collaborate on a body of source code. Git is a complex tool and learning it will take some time. It’s designed to solve problems harder than the ones we will encounter during our projects, so only parts of it will be relevant to learn here. It does, however, solve the problems we will encounter in our projects very well. It’s also widely used in Silicon Valley and across the software industry, if you are into that.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are a couple ways to use Git. Historically, Git was designed to be a command line program that you can type commands for and that’s still a popular way to use it. Most people in Developers’ Guild will probably use the command line interface. There are also nice, pretty graphical user interfaces for Git, including SourceTree and the desktop GitHub app. Feel free to use those if you want, but be aware that they often combine several commands at once during normal operation and it may be hard to understand what it’s doing if you need to fix something.

                    <h3>Our reference book, “Git: Learn to share code”</h3>
                    <p>
                        We wrote a reference book just for Developers’ Guild. It only covers basic topics and is action-oriented. That is, if you know what you want to do, we explain the step necessary to do it without glossing over many fancy terms or explaining concepts.
